              Frontend Mentor has helped tremendously. Working on the newbie
              challenges really helped me get better at building layouts. Also,
              it increased my JavaScript skills. Working with APIs, DOM
              manipulation, and so on greatly increased my knowledge. Would
              totally recommend it.
